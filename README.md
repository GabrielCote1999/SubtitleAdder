<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project :rocket:

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I recently noticed that most of the videos I consumed online contained subtitles.

I find this initiative on the part of content creators very interesting, as it often makes the creator's video more dynamic and accessible.

However, most of the subtitled videos take a lot of time or cost more to make, as they require additional work in editing.

That's why I created Sub. In order to make life easier for online content creators.
